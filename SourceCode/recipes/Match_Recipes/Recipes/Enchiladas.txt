Ingredients:

Sauce:
    1/2 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach
    1 tablespoon butter
    1 tablespoon all purpose flour
    1 cup whipping cream
    1 cup milk
    6 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
    3 green onions, minced
    1/2 4-ounce can diced green chilies, drained
    1 3/4 teaspoons ground cumin
    1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
    1/4 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper

Enchiladas:
    1/2 cup vegetable oil
    12 6-inch corn tortillas
    3 cups grated mild cheddar cheese
    1 1/2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese
    1/2 cup finely chopped onion
    1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
    1/2 cup sour cream


Directions:

Sauce:
1) Cook spinach according to package instructions. Drain well. Set aside.

2) Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. 

3) Add flour and stir mixture 2 minutes; do not brown.

4) Gradually whisk in whipping cream and milk. Simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. 

5) Stir in spinach, cilantro, green onion, chilies, cumin, coriander and red pepper.

6) Puree in batches in processor until almost smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.) 

Enchiladas:
7) Heat oil in heavy small skillet over medium-high heat. 

8) Using tongs, briefly dip each tortilla in oil to soften, about 15 seconds per side. Transfer to paper towels and drain.

9) Combine onion and cilantro in small bowl. 

10) Combine cheeses in large bowl; set aside 1 1/2 cups for topping. Place 1/4 cup cheese mixture in center of 1 tortilla. Spoon 2 teaspoons onion mixture over. 

11) Roll up tortilla. Place seam side down in large glass baking dish.

12) Repeat with remaining tortillas, cheese and onion, using 1/4 cup cheese for each. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) 

13)  Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Stir sour cream into sauce; pour over enchiladas. Sprinkle with reserved 1 1/2 cups cheese. Bake until cheese melts and enchiladas are heated through, about 25 minutes.
