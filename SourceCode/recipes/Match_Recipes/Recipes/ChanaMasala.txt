https://honestcooking.com/restaurant-style-chana-masala-2/

Ingredients:

    2 tbsp coconut oil or vegetable oil
    1 1/2 yellow onions, finely diced (2 cups)
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tsp minced ginger (~1/2" piece)
    4 whole dried red chiles, more or less to taste
    2 green cardamon pods
    2 whole cloves
    1 cinnamon stick
    1 bay leaf
    1 tsp amchoor - dried mango powder (or lemon juice)
    1 tsp ground coriander
    1/2 tsp ground cayenne or hot chili powder
    1/2 tsp garam masala
    1/4 tsp turmeric
    freshly ground black pepper
    1 to 1 1/2 tsp salt to taste
    3 cups cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed
    1 26oz carton Pomi Organic Strained Tomatoes
    1 1/2 tsp kasoori methi, optional
    Handful of minced cilantro, optional


Directions:

1) Heat a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-low heat and add the oil. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook for about 10 minutes until translucent and softened.

2) Add the garlic, ginger, and the whole spices: dried red chiles, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf. Cook for 1-2 minutes stirring constantly so the garlic doesn't burn.

3) Add the ground spices: amchoor (if using), ground coriander, cayenne, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, and 1 tsp of salt. Stir in and let cook for 30 seconds.

4) Add the chickpeas and the Pomi Organic Strained Tomatoes. Partially cover, bring to a simmer, and let simmer for 25-30 minutes stirring occasionally.

5) Turn off the heat, sprinkle in the kasoori methi, crumbling between your fingers. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper. Remove the whole cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and cardamom pods & cloves if you can see them.

6) Serve with a dab of vegan butter to melt on top if desired. Garnish with cilantro and minced yellow onion. Enjoy with basmati rice and/or some garlic naan, and vegan unsweetened yogurt.
