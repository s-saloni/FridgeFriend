Ingredients:

Olive oil
2 slices bread
1/4 small tomato, sliced
4 thin slices mozzarella cheese
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 leaves fresh basil (optional)


Directions:

1) Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium heat and coat lightly with olive oil. 

2) Place 1 piece of bread in the skillet. Lay two pieces of mozzarella cheese on top of the bread.

3) Lay the tomato slices on top of the cheese along with basil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

4) Place the rest of the cheese on top of the tomato and top with the second piece of bread.

5) Check the bottom of the bread; if it is looking golden, flip the sandwich.

6) Place a cast iron skillet on top of the flipped sandwich and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes to finish melting the cheese and toasting the bread.
